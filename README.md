# gnth-auto-exec
auto-execution tool for gobuster, nmap, thcdump and hydra


i just cant remember all the commands and how to compile them, got tired of searching and forgeting were i stored them, so i created simple scripts to automate the process

i use https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists for the wordlists most of the times, i will update the wordlists for the tools to be more automatic, if someone cares

you have to have the given tools to be able to run them

- apt install lolcat
is the only thing needed for this

in general the tools do run and work, i have not found any errors jet, but will keep working on them since i do use them myself
